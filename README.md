## C# .NET Pyramid Device API

* Windows .NET 3.5 Runtime
* Supports Escrow Mode
* Highly Configurable
* Very lightweight library (small dll and low memory consumption)

### Dependencies if you prefer to not use Gradle

* [log4net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/log4net/1.2.10)
    
### Troubleshooting

Mono runtime is untested and folks on Unity may have trouble. We're investigating workarounds and hoping to support Mono. That of course, is dependent on serial port support.
